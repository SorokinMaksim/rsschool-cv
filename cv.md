# Hi! Ma name is Maksim Sorokin.
My main goal, i think, becoming a professional front-end developer. 
To do this, i want to get knowledge, apply them in practice, and progress. 
For me, the opportunity to learn and get useful skills is important.

### Skills

I don't have work experience, but in such courses as *HTML-academy* and *Codeacademy* i got knowledge in: 
 - **CSS** 
 - **HTML** 
- **JavaScript**
 - **Angular** 


### Education

In 2015, finished the *Belarusian Trade and Economic University*, specialty logistics economist. 
in 2017 graduated from the magistracy, in the same specialty.
In 2017 studied at the *STEP Academy*, took courses Java language, but didnâ€™t like it and decided to go in another direction, namely studying JavaScript.
